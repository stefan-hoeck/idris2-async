||| A pool of a fixed number of worker threads, each operating on its own
||| work queue.
|||
||| Idle threads will try and take work packages from other threads
||| (work-stealing). However, work-stealing requires synchronization and
||| communication between workers, so it comes with a considerable overhead.
|||
||| After certain intervals, a worker moves one of its tasks to its
||| "shared" queue. Workers without active tasks will take a task from
||| their own shared queue or from a shared queue of one of their
||| neighbours. If no such task can be found, they sleep (become idle)
||| for a short amount of time.
