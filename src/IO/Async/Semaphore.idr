||| A semphore is a synchronization primitive that can
||| be observed by at most one observer.
|||
||| It consists of an internal counter that is atomically
||| reduced every time `release` is invoked.
|||
||| Calling `await` blocks the calling fiber until the
||| semaphore's counter has been reduced to 0.
export
record Semaphore where
  constructor S
  ref : IORef ST

||| Creates a new semaphore with an internal counter of `n`.

unobs : IORef ST -> IO1 ()
unobs ref =
  casmod1 ref $ \case
    Ini n   => Ini n
    Obs n _ => Ini n

||| Atomically reduces the internal counter of the semaphore by one.

        0 => (Ini 0, cb)

||| Waits (possibly by semantically blocking the fiber)
||| until the semaphore has been released down to zero.
|||
||| Note: Currently, `Semaphore` values can only be observed
|||       by one observer. The calling fiber will block until
|||       canceled, if another fiber has called `await` already.
