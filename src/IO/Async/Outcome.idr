||| Alias for `Either (HSum es) a`: A computation that either
||| succeeds with a result of type `a` or fails with an error
||| of one of the types given in list `es`.
|||
||| Note: If `es` is the empty list, the computation cannot fail,
||| because `HSum []` is uninhabited.

||| Outcome of a fiber that completed its computation.
|||
||| A fiber can either produce a result successfully, fail
||| with an error of one of the types given in the list of types
||| or it can be canceled in which case the outcome is `Canceled`.
